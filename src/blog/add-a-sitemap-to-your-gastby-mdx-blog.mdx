Our blog is getting better and better. Now it's time to add a sitemap.

Strictly speaking, it is not clear if a sitemap is required since Google's page rank algorithm is a black box. BUT Google recommends adding one so let's do it:

## Adding `gatsby-plugin-sitemap`

First, we need to add the official Gatsby sitemap plugin:

```sh
npm i gatsby-plugin-sitemap
```
or
```sh
yarn add gatsby-plugin-sitemap
```
Next, as always, we have to add the newly installed plugin to our config file:

```jsx title=gatsby-node.js
...
{
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sitemap`,
      options: {      
      },
...
```
This will get the plugin loaded, but we need to specify its options because the defaults will do more harm than good otherwise.

### 1. Set the `query` option:

```js
...
  query: `
        {
          site {
            siteMetadata {
              url
            }
          }
          allMdx(sort: {fields: frontmatter___date, order: DESC}, filter: {slug: {glob: "!*wip*"}}) {
            nodes {
              frontmatter {
                date(formatString: "YYYY-MM-DD")
              }
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      `,
...
```
This option lets us get a list of all the pages we'll want to add to our site. We can add more entries manually too, which I'll do next.

### 2. Set the `resolveSiteUrl`

```js
...
        resolveSiteUrl: ({ site: { siteMetadata: { url } } }) => url,
...
```
The plugin uses this setting to set an absolute URL in the sitemap, and as you can see, it references the GraphQL result from the previous query setting.

### 3. Set the `resolvePages` option

```js
        resolvePages: ({ allMdx: { nodes: mdxs } }) => {

          const posts = mdxs.map(mdx => {
            return {
              path: `/blog/${mdx.slug}`,
              lastmod: mdx.frontmatter.date,
              changefreq: 'weekly',
              priority: 0.7,
            }
          })

	// I manually add home and blog entries here

          const home = {
            path: '/',
            lastmod: posts[0].lastmod,
            changefreq: 'daily',
            priority: 0.3,
          }
          const blog = {
            path: '/blog',
            lastmod: posts[0].lastmod,
            changefreq: 'daily',
            priority: 0.3,
          }
          return [...posts, home, blog]
        },
```
We build an array of entries that will form the `sitemap.xml` file. Because posts are added constantly, I'm making a list dynamically from the results of the previous GraphQL query. And then, because the Homepage and the Blog index page do not change their attributes often, I manually add them to the list of entries.'

### 4. Set the serialize option

```js
...
        serialize: ({ path, lastmod, changefreq, priority }) => {
          return {
            url: path,
            lastmod,
            changefreq,
            priority,
          }
        },
...
```
Finally, we need to map the array we built in the `resolvePages` option to the sitemap entries themselves. This will be only a passthrough of properties most of the time because `resolvePages` does most of the work.

For your copy/pasting pleasure, the final code looks like this:

```js title=gatsby-node.js
 {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-sitemap`,
      options: {
        query: `
        {
          site {
            siteMetadata {
              url
            }
          }
          allMdx(sort: {fields: frontmatter___date, order: DESC}, filter: {slug: {glob: "!*wip*"}}) {
            nodes {
              frontmatter {
                date(formatString: "YYYY-MM-DD")
              }
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      `,
        resolveSiteUrl: ({ site: { siteMetadata: { url } } }) => url,
        resolvePages: ({ allMdx: { nodes: mdxs } }) => {

          const posts = mdxs.map(mdx => {
            return {
              path: `/blog/${mdx.slug}`,
              lastmod: mdx.frontmatter.date,
              changefreq: 'weekly',
              priority: 0.7,
            }
          })

          const home = {
            path: '/',
            lastmod: posts[0].lastmod,
            changefreq: 'daily',
            priority: 0.3,
          }

          const blog = {
            path: '/blog',
            lastmod: posts[0].lastmod,
            changefreq: 'daily',
            priority: 0.3,
          }

          return [...posts, home, blog]
        },
        serialize: ({ path, lastmod, changefreq, priority }) => {
          return {
            url: path,
            lastmod,
            changefreq,
            priority,
          }
        },
      },
    }

```

### 5. View your sitemap

If you want to test your newly added sitemap, you have to run `gatsby build` (because the plugin only gets executed in the build phase) and then `gatsby serve`, which will run a web server usually at `http://localhost:9000`.

You can then navigate to `localhost:8000/sitemap/sitemap-index.xml` and it should look something like this:

```xml
<sitemapindex xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
<sitemap>
<loc>https://cesarvarela.com/sitemap/sitemap-0.xml</loc>
</sitemap>
</sitemapindex>
```
There you can follow the first link where you will finally see all your blog entries:

```xml
...
<url>
<loc>https://cesarvarela.com/blog/add-microdata-to-your-gastby-mdx-blog</loc>
<lastmod>2022-10-08T00:00:00.000Z</lastmod>
<changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
<priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
<url>
<loc>https://cesarvarela.com/blog/fix-source-file-requires-different-compiler-version</loc>
<lastmod>2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z</lastmod>
<changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
<priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
<url>
<loc>https://cesarvarela.com/blog/how-to-include-javascript-files-in-gatsby</loc>
<lastmod>2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z</lastmod>
<changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
<priority>0.7</priority>
</url>
...
```

## Bonus: WTF are those Sitemap fields?

If you are new to sitemaps, it will feel a bit cryptic. Let's go over the most relevant options:

### url
**Must** be the canonical URL of the page, in other words, the original source. Avoid having multiple entries on your sitemap pointing to the same page.

### lastmod
As you probably guessed, this is the last modified date. 
** If you mess up this value, Google will simply ignore it** so be careful, but don't worry much about it either since Google's crawler is smart enough to detect page changes all by itself.

### priority
It is a value from 0.0 to 1. Lets you tell Google which pages are more critical relative to other pages on your site. 

### changefreq
specifies how often the contents of the page change, some possible values are `always, hourly, daily, weekly`.


**Again, these are hints, Google's crawler will do as it pleases, and you might as well have 1# rank with no sitemap. **
