If you've followed my previous posts about adding a blog to an existing Gatsby site, you'll notice one thing: images don't load.

Thankfully this is pretty easy to fix, so let's do it:

## Add a `gatsby-source-filesystem` entry for your images

First, we need to let know Gatsby about the existence of our pictures. I want the images to reside inside the `src/blog/images` folder and not in `src/images` (skip this step if you don't care about this).

```js title=gatsby-config.js
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `blog-images`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/blog/images`,
      },
    },
```
## Add the `gatsby-remark-images` package

```sh
yarn add gatsby-remark-images
```
or
```sh
npm i gatsby-remark-images
```
And add it to your Gatsby config:

```js title=gatsby-config.js
...
    `gatsby-remark-images`,
...
```
## Configure `gatsby-plugin-mdx`

Next, we need to tell `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to use  `gatsby-remark-images`, and this is done on your Gatsby config too:

```js title=gatsby-config.js
{
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
      options: {
        root: __dirname,
        gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [
          {
            resolve: 'gatsby-remark-images',
            options: {
              maxWidth: 500,
              linkImagesToOriginal: false,
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    },
```
## Use them in your `.mdx` files

Once everything is ready, you should be able to include them like you would with `.md` files, using a relative path from the current `.mdx` you are writing on to the image:

```mdx title=some-mdx-file.mdx
...

![smart screen of death](./images/smart-screen.png)

....
```
