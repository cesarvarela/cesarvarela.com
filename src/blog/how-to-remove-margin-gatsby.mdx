This is a short and sweet one but might take you a will to realize. Internally Gatsby heavily manipulates the `<body/>` tag, so no matter what you do. Classes and styles won't "stick" to it.

First place these older than the web css rules in a file:

```css title=src/styles.css
html, 
body
#___gatsby {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
``` 

Then create (in case you don't have it already) the following file and import such CSS:

```jsx title=gatsby-browser.js
import "./styles.css"
```

Enjoy a new world without margins nor paddings!
