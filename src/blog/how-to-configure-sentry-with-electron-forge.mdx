title: How to configure Sentry with Electron Forge

Trying to get an electron-forge-based Electron app running is already a task not for the faint of heart. Many worlds are colliding, including the new Electron security practices, Chromium, Node, and the differences between platforms. Add to this the `@sentry/electron` package, and everything gets messier yet.

** if you use `contextIsolation:true`**

After spending a day trying to get Sentry working, these are my discoveries:

## Add both `sentry/electron` and `sentry/react` packages

```shell
yarn add @sentry/electron @sentry/react
```

or

```shell
npm i @sentry/electron @sentry/react --save
```

## Call `Sentry.init` from the `@sentry/electron` package on your `main` process

```js title="main.ts"
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron"

Sentry.init({ dsn: <your dsn> });
```

## Call `Sentry.init` from the `@sentry/electron/dist/renderer` package on your `preload` and `renderer` scripts

```js title="preload.ts AND index.tsx"
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/dist/renderer"

Sentry.init({ dsn: <your dsn> });
```

**notice that the import sentence uses `dist/renderer`**

This will catch errors on the `Ipc` side that has access to the 'electron' package but not on React views (if you are using the react/webpack template for example).

## Use `sentry/react` in your context isolated views

This was one _tricky_... I found about this somewhere in Sentry's Github:

```jsx title=App.jsx
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react"

function FallbackComponent() {
  return <div>An error has ocurred :(</div>
}
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={FallbackComponent} showDialog>
      <YourMainComponent />
    </Sentry.ErrorBoundary>
  )
}
```

## Set `electron` as an external dependency in the renderer webpack config

```js title=webpack.renderer.config.js
  externals: {
    electron: "commonjs electron",
  },
```

If you don't do this, `electron-forge start` will crash with a nasty and unrelated error message.

## There is some stuff left... yet

This will get you something workable, but there is some stuff missing, like `sourcemaps.`, maybe if I have another day to waste.

Good this is that they are aware of this mess: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-electron/issues/360 so there is hope üôè
