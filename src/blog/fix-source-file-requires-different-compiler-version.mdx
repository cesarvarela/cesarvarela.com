title: Fix the infamous "Source file requires different compiler version"

One of the first things you do when starting a new development path is setting up your dev environment. Personally, as a Visual Studio Code believer, I browse the available extensions and install the ones with the most stars ⭐

In my case, I'm starting a new adventure towards the Dapp developer path, so I installed all the solidity/ethereum related extensions I saw. Then, I played around with [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) and the [Truffle tutorial](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorial). Both, to my dismay, greeted me with an error when I followed through them in my editor:

```
Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is *something*) - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
❗ avoid using experimental features! avoid specifying version ^
```

And I haven't written even one line of code of my own!!!

## Ok, to the point

What's causing the `Source file requires different compiler version` error, and how to fix it?

### Who:

It's the [solidity](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity) extension.

### Why:

Because it comes bundled with its own solidity compiler (which is the latest), and most of the tutorials around are using an older version of the language.

### Fix:

Change the source of the compiler for the extension:

- Open the command palette `ctrl+p`
- Type `>` followed by `Change the default workspace`
- Select `remote` and then `Change Global compiler version (Remote)` to your version, or an option that suits your project the best. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity#using-a-different-version-of-the-solidity-compiler)
- Keep the grind
